## Run It on local with Docker and Debug with Edge

1. Run `docker-compose up`
2. Run VSCode Debugger
3. Microsoft Edge Chromium will launch on the correct address.

If you have the extension "[Microsoft Edge Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-edgedevtools.vscode-edge-devtools)", you can open the DevTools on VSCode on it.
