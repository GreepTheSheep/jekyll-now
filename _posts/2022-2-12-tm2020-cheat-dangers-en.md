title: The dangers of lack of security on Trackmania
author: Greep

To highlight the simplicity of cheating on Trackmania, I was able to set a false record on the official Winter 2022 - 01 campaign map in less than 5 minutes (knowing that this record would be deleted shortly)

### Why?

Wanting to make the game evolve, I cheated myself to highlight the major problems that Trackmania and the community are facing

### How?

Using a custom gamemode it is easy to change the characteristics of the car while validating an official map

### Problems:

The relevant problem is most on the server side of the game:

Ubisoft Connect Accounts:

To create an account, normally, you just have to write down a username, an email and the password. Then comes the email verification (with a link or a verification code), but here, the verification is simply optional, which lets any kind of troll/spam/cheat account enter, the door is wide open.


I don't buy the higher editions of Trackmania, I'm currently on the starter edition.

The limitations of the starter access are:
- Impossible to play community maps
- Impossible to join an online community server
- Impossible to have the advanced map editor, so, impossible to use customs or items
- The possibility to play the seasonal campaign, and the training campaign.
- The possibility to play the official 3v3 matchmaking
- The possibility to play the Royal mode, but not the possibility to learn the maps of this mode (the server "Royal Maps" is classified as a community server)

Why do I dot the word "online community server"?

Simply that in fact it is clearly possible to join a server, but only locally (even dedicated servers).

You just had to download a dedicated server, and launch it. This implies yet another flaw on the point of "playing community maps", indeed, you just had to download a map on TrackmaniaExchange, and launch the server, all starter editions can play community maps with this method. And it's the same with the server scripts

To make it simple, I use a local dedicated server with the map Winter 2022 - 01 with the custom gamemode, all in starter edition.


The current problem comes from the records server.

Allowing records to be sent on a custom script is clearly a flaw.

Two gamemode developers have already had the same hit. They had reported this to Nadeo, a year and a half ago. But this has not been corrected yet.

"they already knew about it, I had cheated for a while with an old version of the mode that only disabled the leaderboard on the first map loaded, and not the following ones"

![Report 2](https://i.imgur.com/CjAWOsF.png)


From my point of view, I would favor custom gamemodes, but records should not be sent, this should be limited to the basic official gamemodes (The "TM_TimeAttack_Online" gamemode for example).

An alternative could be to have customs gamemodes verified by Nadeo, which would make the records of this gamemode eligible or not (a bit like the verified clubs currently).


### What happened after that run?

One minute after sending this record, the Trackmania Discord server was instantly called and a moderator (who knows me well) contacted me in private.

He immediately asked me to contact the members of Nadeo, which I clearly did.

Here is the message I gave:

`Hello, I come to tell you that I set a cheated record on Winter 2022 - 01, in fact I was playing with a server script that allows to modify the physics of the game. But when I finished the run I saw directly on tm.io that the record was there. So I ask that this record be removed and I apologize in advance.`

`[The moderator] told me right away that I should contact one of you to correct it as soon as possible, which I am doing.`

Then comes a discussion of why, which I wrote above.

The protocol, said below, is that the account will be banned from the game and the records will be deleted. Also, my name will not be mentioned so that my main account will not be affected. I thank them.

At the time of writing this report, the account is well banned and the record is deleted.

### Some videos

I put in link some videos and clips of the cheated run. In particular 2 Twitch clips, the one of Birdie to which he reacts without giving his opinion, and the one of Spammiej who gives his opinion very quickly.

### Thanks

I thank Nadeo for helping me solve this problem quickly, and were very understanding.

I thank the community that was surprised. And who have, I think, understood about the consequences of cheat on an online game that is very new.

And above all, note that the cheat is very bad, it could have serious consequences that could happen quickly.
