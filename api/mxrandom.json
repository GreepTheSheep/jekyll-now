We are therefore going to ban some Openplanet plugins from the challenge.\nThe only plugin that we are currently going to ban is the [Predictor](https://openplanet.nl/files/160), the reasons for this ban are simple: This plugin predicts your time on finish, but it will help you a lot if you have the author time even before you have the last checkpoint, which gives you a phenomenal lead.\nWe hope you will understand this choice."
